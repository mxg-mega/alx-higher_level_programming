Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL
In the container, credentials are root/root

- Using Ubuntu 20.04
- In the Terminal, you should start MySQL before playing with it:
```
$ service mysql start                                                   
 * Starting MySQL database server mysqld 
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p                               
Database                                                                                   
information_schema                                                                         
mysql                                                                                      
performance_schema                                                                         
sys                      
$
```
In the container, credentials are root/root

## How to import a SQL dump
